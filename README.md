# Library API

The Library API is a comprehensive backend service designed to optimize the management of library resources. It features endpoints for managing books, authors, users, and borrowing records. To ensure security, the API utilizes JWT authentication, offering a robust system for user verification and token handling.

## Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure the access to the API with JSON Web Tokens.
- **Token Revocation**: The system enforces single-use validity for tokens, meaning each token can only be used once. This approach significantly enhances security by preventing token reuse, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or replay attacks.
- **CRUD Operations**: It manages users, authors, book, and book-author relationships.


## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Core backend logic using the Slim framework.
- **Slim Framework**: Lightweight and fast framework for PHP.
- **Firebase JWT**: Library for handling JSON Web Tokens.
- **PSR-7**: HTTP message interfaces for standardized request and response handling.

## Authentication (JWT)

### Overview

The API employs JWT for secure authentication:  
- Clients are required to provide a token in the `Authorization` header with every request.  
- Tokens are verified and invalidated after a single use to prevent reuse.  
- Revoked tokens are managed and tracked through PHP sessions.  

### Token Management

- **Generation**: Tokens are generated after successful login.
- **Validation**: Middleware ensures the token is valid and not expired.
- **Revocation**: Tokens are invalidated after their first use.
